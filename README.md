# Rare-variant association analysis of whole genome sequencing obtained from multi-ancestry families reveals new Alzheimer’s Disease genes

This repository contains notebooks and scripts for reproducing analyses and figures from the paper "Rare-variant association analysis of whole genome sequencing obtained from multi-ancestry families reveals new Alzheimer’s Disease genes".
This research was conducted using sequence data from Estudio Familiar de Influencia Genetica en Alzheimer (EFIGA), the National Institute on Aging Late Onset Alzheimer's disease (NIA-LOAD) and Alzheimer’s Disease Sequencing Project (ADSP). We used in-house workflows  that are of public access at our [CUMC] (https://github.com/cumc/bioworkflows/tree/master/GWAS) github repository  to analyze the data for this paper

**Requirements**

The analyses were based on [SoS pipile] (https://vatlab.github.io/sos-docs/) and needs to refer the [SoS suite setup](https://wanggroup.org/orientation/jupyter-setup) for instructions on how to install and set up SoS and jupyter notebooks.
